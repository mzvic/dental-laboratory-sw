# Organization Work Software

This software will help you in the productivity and organization in all the jobs you have to do as a freelancer or in your mini enterprise.
This code was made to test my skills, but it can be useful, so that's why I'm sharing it.
## Why is useful?

You can do  a lot of things:

- Save the names of your clients
- Save the names of your jobs that you do
- Add current jobs you have to do including the Deadline
- See all the jobs you have to do, filtering with the name of the client
## Requiriments

This project is optimized to Linux/MacOs, but it can also work in Windows or other OS.
To make it run you need to install:
- PyQt5
```
pip3 install pyqt5
```


## Installation 

Clone the code in a folder then execute 'meny.py' with:
```
python3 designer/menu.py
```
## How this works?

First you had to add:
- All the jobs you do in your work
- All the clients that you attend

Then you can start adding jobs in the 'New Current Job' option. The works that you add will show in 'To Do' with all the specifications that you put. Then, you can start doing things and checking as 'Done' with the 'Mark as done' button. That workflow improves and organize all the things you have to do.
## Feedback

I know it's full of bugs, so if you have any feedback, please reach me at to vmontesinos2021@udec.cl.
